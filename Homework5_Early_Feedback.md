### Early Feedback for Homework 5 (THIS IS NOT YOUR GRADE, the assignment isn't due yet)

These tests are run on Monday and Tuesday nights around 11:55 PM, so if you didn't submit before then you can ignore this document

Passing these tests is not a guarantee of a perfect homework score: the tests do not check everything that the TAs will.

Any questions/errors with the Automated Feedback should be reported to Nathan Taylor: taylo750@umn.edu

Run on October 08, 01:57:27 AM.
