### Early Feedback for Homework 9 (THIS IS NOT YOUR GRADE, the assignment isn't due yet)

These tests are run on Monday and Tuesday nights around 11:55 PM, so if you didn't submit before then you can ignore this document

Passing these tests is not a guarantee of a perfect homework score: the tests do not check everything that the TAs will.

Any questions/errors with the Automated Feedback should be reported to Nathan Taylor: taylo740@umn.edu

```
Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise .
I thought not .
It's not a story the Jedi would tell you .
It's a Sith legend .
Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life .
He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying .
The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural .
He became so powerful the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power which eventually of course he did .
Unfortunately he taught his apprentice everything he knew then his apprentice killed him in his sleep .
Ironic .
He could save others from death but not himself .
